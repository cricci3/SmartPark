## üèó System Architecture

### Hardware Components Organization

- **Floor Level**:
  - 3x ToF sensors per floor
  - 3x RGB LEDs per floor
  - 1x Arduino Portenta H7
  - 1x I2C multiplexer
  - Power distribution system

- **Entrance Level**:
  - 1x Arduino Portenta H7
  - 1x OLED display
  - Network connection components

### Software Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Floor Controllers**
   - Monitor parking spot sensors
   - Manage LED status indicators
   - Publish status updates via MQTT
   - Handle fault detection and recovery

2. **Entrance Display Controller**
   - Subscribes to floor status updates
   - Manages OLED display
   - Provides real-time availability information

3. **Web Application Interface**
   - Real-time monitoring dashboard
   - WebSocket-based MQTT communication
   - Visual representation of parking status

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Communication Protocol

- MQTT broker: test.mosquitto.org:1883
- Topics structure:  ```parking/floorX ``` (where X is the floor number)
- Message format: comma-separated values representing stall states
- Update frequency: 2.5 seconds

### Sensor Implementation

- Detection range: 10mm - 50mm
- I2C communication with multiplexer
- Continuous monitoring with error checking

### Fault Tolerance

- Watchdog timer implementation (5000ms timeout)
- Automatic system recovery
- Independent floor operation
- Graceful degradation support

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE with Portenta H7 board support
- Required Libraries:
  - MQTT Client
  - Adafruit_VL53L0X
  - Adafruit_SSD1306
  - mbed RTOS

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cricci3/SmartPark
   ```

2. Install required libraries through Arduino Library Manager
